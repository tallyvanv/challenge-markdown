## A funny story

My friend's second band broke up. This happened right after their last show. Right after,
I joined her on tour with her first band. During the first gig, a fan (an older gentleman), came up to us
and asked me if I could take a picture of the two of them. 
As I was taking the picture, I noticed the image on his T-shirt. The people on it looked like the members of the other 
band. When we asked the man about it, he said it was based on a picture of the band's final gig.
Obviously, they had never made merch of this because they broke up right after.
Yes, it was a bootleg T-shirt of the worst gig ever.


### TL;DR

Right after my friend's band broke up, she met a man who made a bootleg T-shirt of their final show.
